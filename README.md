## The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

![](./assets/diagram.jpg)

- `Identity Service`: The Identity Service is a bounded context for authenticate and authorize users through with [Identity Server](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer). Also, this service is responsible for creating users and their corresponding roles and permission with using [.Net Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) and Jwt authentication and authorization.

- `Flight Service`: The Flight Service is a bounded context for all operation related to flight and get available filght and seat.

- `Passenger Service`: The Passenger Service is a bounded context for managing our passengers information, track the activities and subscribing to get notification for out of stock products

- `Reservation Service`: The Passenger Service is a bounded context for managing all operation related to reserve flight ticket.


## Structure of Project

I used `yarp` reverse proxy for routes synchronous and asynchronous request to the corresponding microservice. and each microservices has own business and dependencies such as databases, files and etc. and each microservices is decuple from other microservices and develop and deploy separately. and these microservices talk to each other with synchronous call like Rest or gRpc and use RabbitMq or Kafka for asynchronous call.

We have separate microservice ([IdentityServer](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer)) for authentication and authorization and each request go to API Gateway and then route to Identity microservices and after authentication and authorization back API Gateway and then route to expected microservices.

Also here I used `RabbitMQ` as my MessageBroker for async communication between the microservices with using eventually consistency mechanism. and top of that I use `MassTransit` provides many requirements in microservice projects such as messaging, availability, reliability and etc. 

Microservices are `event based` which means they can publish and/or subscribe to any events occurring in the setup. By using this approach for communicating between services, each microservice does not need to know about the other services or handle errors occurred in other microservices.

Here I used `Outbox Pattern` for Guaranteed Delivery and can be used as a landing zone for integration events before they are published to the message broker .

Outbox pattern ensures that a message was sent (e.g. to a queue) successfully at least once. With this pattern, instead of directly publishing a message to the queue, we store it in the temporary storage (e.g. database table) for preventing missing any message and some retry mechanism in any failure (At-least-once Delivery). For example When we save data as part of one transaction in our service, we also save messages (Integration Events) that we later want to process in another microservices as part of the same transaction. The list of messages to be processed is called an OutboxMessages. Also we have a background service OutboxProcessorBackgroundService that periodically checks the our outbox messages in the database and try to send the messages to the broker. After it gets confirmation of publishing (e.g. ACK from the broker) it marks the message as processed to avoid resending. However, it is possible that we will not be able to mark the message as processed due to communication error, for example broker is unavailable. In this case our Outbox Background Service try to resend the messages that not processed and it is actually At-Least-Once delivery. We can be sure that message will be sent once, but can be sent multiple times too! That’s why another name for this approach is Once-Or-More delivery. We should remember this and try to design receivers of our messages as Idempotents, which means:

> In Messaging this concepts translates into a message that has the same effect whether it is received once or multiple times. This means that a message can safely be resent without causing any problems even if the receiver receives duplicates of the same message.

For handling Idempotency and Exactly-once Delivery in receiver side, we could use `Inbox Pattern`.

In this is a pattern similar to Outbox Pattern. It’s used to handle incoming messages (e.g. from a queue) for unique processing of a single message only once (even with executing multiple time). Accordingly, we have a table in which we’re storing incoming messages. Contrary to outbox pattern, we first save the messages in the database, then we’re returning ACK to queue. If save succeeded, but we didn’t return ACK to queue, then delivery will be retried. That’s why we have at-least-once delivery again. After that, an inbox background process runs and will process the inbox messages that not processed yet. also we can prevent executing a message with specific MessgaeIdmultiple times. after executing our inbox message for example with calling our subscribed event handlers we send a ACK to the queue when they succeeded. (Inbox part of the system is in progress, this issue)

Also I used a [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) with using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library in my controllers for a clean and [thin controller](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/), also instead of using a `application service` class because after some times our controller will depends to different services and this breaks single responsibility principle. We use mediator pattern to manage the delivery of messages to handlers. One of the advantages behind the [mediator pattern](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) is that it allows the application code to define a pipeline of activities for requests . For example in our controllers we create a command and send it to mediator and mediator will route our command to a specific command handler in application layer.

To support [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), the implementation of cross-cutting concerns is done using the mediatr [pipeline behaviors](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) or creating a [mediatr decorators](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/).

Also in this project I used mix of [clean architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/) and [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) and also I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) in this project.

Also here I used cqrs for decompose my features to very small parts that make our application

- maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- adding new feature to this mechanism is very easy without any breaking change in other part of our codes. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.
- easy to maintain and any changes only affect on one command or query and avoid any breaking changes on other parts
- it gives us better separation of concerns and cross cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines) in our code instead of a big service class for doing a lot of things.

I treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
When adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many different "layers" in an application. we are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice. we `Minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

![](./assets/Vertical-Slice-Architecture.jpg)

With using CQRS pattern, we cut each business functionality into some vertical slices, and inner each of this slices we have [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders) specific to that feature (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, ...). In Our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.
